## Project Orcdle Privacy Policy
Orcdle does not gather any information beyond basic application stability, performance, and usage metrics. This data will be managed in Google's analytics and crash reporting systems. No personally identifiable information is gathered or desired, just information needed by me to resolve crashes and understand app usage patterns.

All application data is stored locally on the device and may be backed up in the device's associated Google account, leaving it all under your control.

If some manner of game sharing feature is implemented then the sending of any player information, ie game records or user name, will be opt-in and no information will be transfered beyond the minimum required for the feature to work will be transfered.

This document may be updated periodically, for example to clarify a point or support additional application features. These changes will be tracked in the history of this repository. I will endeavour to avoid making any change that would cause a significant expansion of the use of personal data without an explicit opt-in.

In the event that there is a change that means you no longer wish for your data to be handled by me you can contact me at the email address below.

If you have any questions or inquiries you can contact me at:
